Simple to use Mods to apply to UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite)

# Tutorial

1. Download the latest UEFN-ExposeAll File.
2. Put that file into your Fortnite Installation's Content Folder, example:
/YourLocation/FortniteGame/Content/
Right there is where you will place it
(usually in the C: Drive Program Files under Epic Games.)

3. Enjoy, your editor should now contain everything that is allowed as a exposed asset, to find these:

Inside of the "Fortnite" folder in the Content Browser, you should find a new folder called "Exposed Content".
This Content can also otherwise be accessed by searching for it like you do in regular UEFN.

TO EPIC: Feel free to contact me via X DMs if you wish to take this down.
